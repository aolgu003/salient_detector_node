Software description
---------------------
Salient detector will run salient detection at a rate of 5 - 15 Hz. It will read an image from the spotter camera topic and simultaneously grab navigation information from the mavlink_comms. 

The image will be used to create an 8 MP saliency map of the image. Using the saliency map the detector will be crop regions of interest by thresholding the image and filtering ROI by size.

Next the approximate location of the target in the NED fram will be calculated and published at a rate of 15 hz.
